            <hr class="my-4">
            <p class=" mb-4"> How many times have you been searching Netflix, Hulu, HBO, IMDb or other similar web services for a good movie to watch? How many times have you thought to yourself, 'Darn it! I just want to watch a movie like Moneyball, what a great movie!' or, 'I really liked Shawshank Redemption where can I find something similar?' If you have experienced this horrible life experience, of either searching for a movie and not finding any, or just wanting to see something similar to your favorite movie. We're here for you! We've created the solution, the last recommendation engine you'll need! The engine uses both text analysis and network theory to predict what movies you want to see based on what movies you like. By scrolling to the bottom of this webpage, or, by simply clicking <a class = "makeWhite" href="#searcher"><span class="download"> here</span></a> you can access the recommendation engine immediately. However, if you are interested in reading about how the engine works, you can simply scroll downwards this website, where all the relevant info will be covered.

              <h4 class="section-heading">The dataset</h4>

              <p>
                In order to make the recommendation engine, we needed to gather information about a loads of movie's. Furthermore, multiple datasets where needed to build the recommendation engine, as all of them included some unique useful elements to build the engine. Firstly, a dataset from Kaggle was used. The dataset isn’t quite big, around 50 mb, but it contains a lot of information. It includes close to 20 properties for around 5000 movies. Next, as we wanted to make use of text analysis the storyline from IMDb was scraped for all the movies in the Kaggle dataset. In addition to that the IMDb rating for each movie in the Kaggle dataset was also scraped. Lastly, a ton of movie scripts and reviews for each movie in the dataset where found. The idea was to use sentiment analysis and similarity measures on these texts, to figure out if a movie is happy or similar to some other movie. All the datasets can be found and downloaded

                 </a>
                Finally we did a lot of interesting analysis on the datasets and it is thourougly explained in the explainer notebook which can be accessed

            <p>In order to get a better feel for the dataset we take a look at some important measures of our datasets. We start off by looking at the scraped data from IMDb. The first figure shows the distribution of the ratings, while the second the storyline similarity distribution. From the first figure we can see that most ratings are around 6.5, the mean rating is 6.42. It is also interesting to see that there are very few movies in the extreme ends of the plot. The distribution looks somewhat like the gaussian distribution where the vast majority of the values fall around the mean value. As most people would rather watch movies with higher IMDb rating, preferably higher than 7, we can use this information to influence the search engine.

            The second figure then shows the distribution of similarities between the movie storylines. Here we used TF-IDF and cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between movies. Most movies do not have any similarity, as you would expect. It would be pretty awful if the engine would conclude that 'Cat Woman' and 'Shawshank Redemption' where the one and the same, wouldn’t it? However, the similarity works quite well. The movies which are similar get a higher value, e.g. 'Iron Man' and 'Iron Man 2' are pretty similar. The figure below shows the distribution of the similarities, there we see that although the cosine distance is between 0 and 1, the values in the distribution are only between 0 and 0.5. We utilize this fact when building the network. Note that the figure below excludes the movies with zero similarity, as they are so many that you can't really see the distribution of the other similarities. However, we suggest that interested readers look at the <span class="download">explainer notebook</span> for a more detailed description.

          </div>


        <p class = "addMargin">Now it’s time to go through the Kaggle dataset. As mentioned earlier, it has a bunch of variables. However, when building the network, they aren’t equally important. When watching a movie there are some things that are more important than others. You would watch a movie because it has great actors, directors, is a part of a particular genre or has some other exciting things about it. The figures below show the actors/actresses which have starred in the most movies and the directors which have directed most movies. When looking at the names of the actors/actresses one might think that Star Wars fans would be happy as we have two great actors from there. Furthermore, it is surprising that Nicholas Cage is not in the most common actors/actresses list, as he has starred in a lot of movies! The directors are all well known, and as can be seen have directed many movies. One interesting thing regarding these results is that these are all males. This clearly shows the male dominance in the movie business. However, that is a material for another post.</p>
        

           <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/actors.PNG" alt="">
          </div>

           <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/directors.PNG" alt="">
          </div>

          <p class = "addMargin">
           Finally, we look at how the distribution of the genre is in the movies. We see that there is a huge class imbalance in our dataset, there are so many 'Drama' movies and so few 'TV Movies'. This is a problem we need to be aware of. The figure here show the count of movies associated with each genre (movies can have multiple genres). 

           Next, we look at the popularity of keywords associated with each movie. Every movie in the Kaggle dataset has a bunch of keywords associated to them. These words are supposed to describe the movie. It is interesting to see that 'women director' is the most common keyword. It seems to be quite important to illustrate the fact that it was actually a woman that directed the movie. This again (we have seen this multiple times in the analysis) shows how male dominant this industry is. The fact that a woman directs the movie seems to be considered as a special feature of the movie and the movie producers think that it is important to illustrate that fact by having it as a keyword of the movie.
          Everything else seems to be like one could expect. The cities 'New York', 'Los Angeles' and 'London' are also highly used keywords which illustrates the fact that most movies are supposed to occur in these cities.
          'Sex' and 'Love' are also on the list which is not surprising, we all know that humans like to watch movies that involve love and sex scenes. More interestingly is to see that 'Violence', 'Revenge' and 'Murder' are more frequently used than 'Love' and 'Sex'.

            <p class = "addMargin">The figure here on the side shows the correlation between all the variables in the Kaggle dataset.
              The correlation between the TMDb rating and the IMDb rating is interesting, there seems to be less positive correlation between these values than one would expect. This is most likely do to the fact that the TMDb rating is based on much less data, fewer votes on average, than the IMDb rating. Based on this information we decided to only use the IMDb ratings in further analysis of the dataset.
            Interestingly we see that the budget and the revenue of a movie is highly correlated which means that if a movie has a high budget then the movie is more likely to get higher revenue in the end. Like everyone knows, you need to spend money to make money! The reader can look deeper into the figure to see how the variables in the dataset correlate. However, if the reader is lazy, we again highly recommend checking out the <span class="download">explanatory notebook</span> to be fed like a toddler with juicy code and explanations.

          <p class = "addMargin"> Next, we bring you the WORDCLOUD. The figures in the carousel down below show the keywords which describe each genre the best. It is interesting to see that 'woman director' is a frequently used keyword in comedies and romantic movies. Love is frequently used in 'Fantasy' movies, this is something one would probably not expect? Or at least the writers of this post where clueless about. Most romantic movies seem to occur in New York, not Paris, we don’t believe the French will be happy with this. Either way, everything else is quite like you would expect, it is quite fun to see what keywords are used most frequently in each genre. We encourage an interested reader to take a look at these word clouds.</p>

        <hr class="my-4">
        <div class="row">
        
        <p>The initial idea was to find manuscripts for all of the 5000 movies from the Kaggle dataset. Then analyze these manuscripts and calculate both similarities between movies and sentiment score for each movie. This information could then be fed to the recommendation engine as two variables. This would help the engine distinguish between happy and sad movies. Furthermore, the similarity measure could help the recommendation engine to find movies with similar languages. </p>

        
           
          
           <p> We start this section of by looking at the 10 happiest movies and the10 most unhappy movies. Looking at the figures donw bellow we cant say that the results are suprising. The movies with the highest average sentiment score are all so called "feel good movies", which any sane perason would expect before hand to have quite happy vocabulary. When taking a look at the movies with the  lowest sentiment score, we are not suprised. These are all movies that are eather action or horror movies, where the movie envolves around death or war.
           

            Next we take a look at the variance. If a movie has a large variance in the sentiment values of its manuscript then the vocabulary used in the manuscript must be quite diversed, meaning that that the movie  must contain a lot of happy and unhappy words. The 10 movies with most variance are movies that are considered as a Thriller/Action/Crime/Horror and a Comedy/Romance. Like for example the movie Deadpool; it is a dark comedy which is also consider to be a action or a adventure movie. Deadpool is a comedy that contains a lot of violence and so it is understandable that the happiness rank of the words used in the manuscript vary alot.


            The bottom 10 list are all movies that is either about something happy, like comedies or romance movies or they are on the darker side of spectrum meaning that the storyline is about something which can be considered unhappy, like Horror movies, dark Drama movies or dark Action/Thriller movies. Therefore the sentimental value of the words used in the manuscript do not vary as much.

           </p>

<div class="col-lg-6 text-center" style ="margin: 10px"></div>
    <p>Note: We do not have equal amount of manuscripts for each genre, therefore the result cannot be taken as the whole truth but this still gives us a good idea of the behavior.
The genres Music, Romance, Comedy, Drama and Family are the 5 genres with the highest average of the mean sentiment values like one could have expected. These genres of movies seem to have the happiest manuscripts on average based on the LabMT wordlist.
Similarly it is easy to understand why War, Western, Action and Horror movies have low mean sentiment values on average. Movies within these genres are often about the dark sides of life and therefore the moviescripts contain a lot of words that we human consider unhappy words. Words like war, guns, fights and so on.
The genres History, Drama, Comedy and Fantasy seem to have the most variance of the mean happyness value of the manuscripts. This shows us that these genres have diverse movies within the genre, meaning that some of the movies within the genre are considered to be sad or unhappy while other movies in the same genre are considered happy. It is trivial to agree with these findings. Let's take the History genre for example; one history movie can be about war which would be considered something sad and then there could be another history movie in the database that is about how love has changed over the years, that movie would be consider to be quite positive or happy.
The movies Family and Western have the least variance within the average of the mean sentiment values. This is also something that we can easily agree with. Movies that are classified as family movies are most often about something that is happy, something that the whole family can watch together and are so called "feel good movies". There are not many family movies that are about something dark and unhappy and Therefore the median and the mean sentiment value is quite high for these types of movies and the variance of the mean value is low. In contrast, western movies are nearly all about something dark; fights, war, robbery or life struggle. There are few happy western movies out there, at least we haven't seen a single one in our life.
The genre Science Fiction contains the least average variance within the sentiment values of each manuscript. This came as a surprise to us. The vocabulary used in the Science Fiction's manuscripts does not vary as much between very happy words and very unhappy words like the for the other genres.
The genres with the highest average variance within the vocabulary of the manuscripts is Music, Romance, Comedy, Fantasy and Western. The first three genres are understandable because one can expect movies of these genres to have vocabulary that varies quite alot between happy and sad words but the genre Western caught our attention. The vocabulary used in the western movies seems to be diverse which we did not expect in the beginning but when you think about it these movies often contain some romantic stories within the storyline and therefore most often contain some amount of words that are considered to be happy.</p>

           <div class="col-lg-12">
            <h2 class="mb-4 text-center">Networks</h2>
            <hr class="my-4">

          <div class="col-lg-12">
              <h4 class="mb-4">Intro</h4><p>The end goal is that a user inputs a name of a movie (which is a node in a network) and from that movie we find all the shortest distances in the network and recommend these movies wich are closest. We decided it would be best to implement a weighted network, since nodes which are connected can have different importance. For example, if we have some movie, lets say 'Iron Man', our network can have multiple links from that movie. However, the movies it links to are not all equally similar to 'Iron Man', and thus we add weights to the edges. Lastly a movie with few edges can be similar to some movies which are not connected to them directly, but there might be a short path in the network which connects them. We first tried three other networks that did not yield the desired result and wouldn't suffice as the basis of our recommendation engine. We therefore decided to combine those three networks and a bit more of data into one big network. The main network is built upon our analysis on the simpler networks. In order to make a link in the network, some similarities between the movies must exist. It was decided that what mattered in order to make a link between movies was: keywords, genres, actors/actresses and directors. In addition to that we looked at IMDb ratings and how similar the storylines of movies were.</p>
          </div>  

          <div class="col-lg-6">
              <h4 class="mb-4">Constructing the network</h4><p>
              When making the network various decisions regarding what constraints needed to be fulfilled to make an edge and what the weight of that edge should be. We start the discussion on the constraints. The constraints build upon four dimensions: genre, keywords, actors and director. All of these things are calculated in a similar fashion. We find all the common things in both movies, by their; genres, keywords, actors and directors and then we normalize it by dividing by the movie which has less items in each dimension. Each of these values are then multiplied by an importance coefficent, and if the total sum of the dimension varibles is more than 0.3 we make an edge. The value of the importance was choosen by guesswork and trial-and-error. Since there is no correct answer to which movies you recommend we tweaked it until we were happy with the results generated. Howver, there were some things we kept in mind though. Firstly, note that the sum of the dimension varibles can at maximum have the value of 1. Next when looking at the importance coefficent, one can observe that none of them has a value greater than 0.3. This forces our network to make a connection only if at least two dimension variables are shared. Next when assigning a weight to the edge we subtract both the sum of the varibles which satisfied the constraint and the similarities between the movies with 1.4 (so we dont get any negative weights). This way, movies that have similar keywords, genre, actors, directors and storylines are closer in the network. Note that we use the similarity between storylines only in deciding on the weight of the edge. The reason for this is that altough the movies might have similar storylines the movies could be very different. For example a romance and a horrors story might connect, depending on the language used in the storyline on IMDB. Furthermore, there exists only so few storylines.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-6">
             <h4 class="mb-4">Information about the network</h4><p>We can see from the images below that this network looks good. We also see that the degree distribution follows a power law, which tells us that this is a scale-free network. 
             Therefore it can be seen that there are hubs in this network meaning that there are small number of movies that are very similar to many other movies but the vast amount of the movies have low degree value which means that they only link to few other movies. So this indicates that there are some movie´s in the network, which will more frequently be recommended than others. Furthermore, these hubs may possably link other movies together as many movies travel trough them.        Deciding which properties and their weight to us took some time and was mostly fine-tuned through trial-and-error. We tested it on 'Iron Man 2' and the 5 most similar movies according to the network were: 'Iron Man', 'Iron Man 3', 'Captain America: Civil War', 'Zathura: A Space Adventure' and 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron'. Only movie that kinda stood out there in our eyes was 'Zathura' but it turns out that, among other things, it is directed by the same director as 'Iron Man 2'.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>We are all huge movie fans and therefore we had a lot of fun doing this project. We did a lot of analysis on the data set like you have probably noticed. We are quite happy about our findings and we are really proud of the final version of the recommendation engine. The recommendation engine is functioning quite well and we'll definitely be using it ourselves during the x-mas break when looking for movies to watch and we encourage you to try it out on the website.
        <br>
        <br>
        Although it turned out great we tried quite a lot of different things before we were satisfied. For the network part we looked at three different networks. We created a network where movies were connected if they shared a certain percentage of their keywords. We did the same for genres as well as one network where nodes were cast members and nodes were linked if the cast members had starred together in a certain number of movies. After analyzing each of the networks we decided that none of them were good enough. This resulted in us creating a fourth network (can be seen above) which would combine the properties of the previous three. Movies were nodes and to create links to other movies we looked at multiple properties e.g. cast members, keywords, genres, directors and similarities in story line. After links have been created and we’re in the process of recommending we also look at IMDb ratings.
        <br>
        <br>
        The text analysis itself went well but it ended up not being used in the recommendation engine except for the storylines of the movies. The reason for this was that the data we had for text analysis, ~14.000 reviews and ~1.000 movie scripts, only applied to a subset of our 4800 movies. We didn't want to make the number of movies that we could recommend less than it was at the beginning. We did a lot of text analysis and made a proof of concept that the data could’ve been used in the recommendation engine. This tells us that we could have further improved the engine by getting manuscripts and reviews for all our movies. If not the manuscripts then we could've perhaps gotten the subtitle texts for each movie and do the same analysis on those texts and used the information to further improve our engine.</p>
